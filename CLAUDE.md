# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository. `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file, so other coding agents read the same
instructions — edit this file, not the symlink.

## Project Overview

This is a meal planning repository that implements a HelloFresh-like workflow for Swedish households. The system uses **multi-agent orchestration** to help with weekly meal planning through a structured 5-phase process: brainstorming → recipe selection → shopping list generation → recipe compilation → meal prep planning.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

  ├── Phase 1: brainstorming-agent (sonnet)
  ├── Phase 2: recipe-researcher × N (sonnet, PARALLEL — one per dish)

```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Parallel recipe research**: Phase 2 spawns one `recipe-researcher` agent per dish, all running in parallel. Each researcher compares 3-5 sources independently.
- **Subagents can't spawn subagents**: The main conversation acts as orchestrator. Alternatively, use `claude --agent meal-planning-orchestrator` for automated orchestration.
- **Skills preloaded into orchestrator**: The orchestrator agent has `meal-planning-hello-fresh` skill injected at startup via the `skills` field.

## Recipe Standard: Rules + Hooks (deterministic)

Recipe formatting is **not** left to prompt adherence. The convention lives in one
place and is enforced mechanically:

| Layer | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Convention | `.claude/rules/recipe-style.md` | The recipe standard. Path-scoped — loads only when working with recipe files. |
| Few-shot | `.claude/rules/recipe-examples.md` | One gold recipe + good/bad pairs with reasoning. |
| Enforcement | `.claude/hooks/recipe_guard.sh` (PostToolUse on `Write`/`Edit`) | Normalizes mechanical issues in place, feeds remaining errors back to Claude. |
| Gate | `.claude/hooks/subagent_recipe_gate.sh` (SubagentStop) | `recipe-creator` / `recipe-compiler` can't finish while their recipes have errors. Releases after 2 blocked attempts so it can't loop. |
| Cross-check | `.claude/hooks/validate_week.py` | Every ingredient in `04` must appear in `03` with sufficient quantity. |
| Manual + CI | `/verify-recipes`, `.github/workflows/recipe-lint.yml` | Same validator on demand and on PRs (changed files only). |

**The rule that matters most:** every instruction step repeats the amount inline
(`Häll **1,5 dl** mjölk över **1 dl** ströbröd`), because the reader is standing at
the stove and won't scroll back to the ingredient list.

When the hook reports `RÄTTAT`, the file on disk was already changed — re-read it
before editing further. `FEL` must be fixed, not explained away. `TIPS` is advisory.

Recipes in `recipe/` predate the standard and are not yet migrated; convert one only
when asked, rather than running a mass migration.

## Core Workflow & Architecture

### Phase-Gated Process (CRITICAL)

The workflow has **mandatory stop points** between phases. Never proceed to the next phase without explicit user approval:

1. **Phase 1 (Brainstorming)**: Generate meal candidates based on preferences
   - Stop and wait: User selects dishes or provides own recipes

2. **Phase 2 (Recipe Selection)**: Parallel recipe research + custom recipe creation
   - Stop and wait: Ask "Vill du att jag skapar handlingslista nu?" — and, if `stapelvaror.md`
     has `vid behov` items, which of those are needed this week (and whether any `varje vecka`
     item should be skipped)

3. **Phase 3 (Shopping List)**: Generate pooled, consolidated shopping list
   - Stop and wait: Ask "Vill du att jag skapar receptsamling och meal prep-plan nu?"

4. **Phase 4 (Recipe Compilation)**: Compile all recipes into standardized format (`04-alla-recept.md`)
   - No stop point — continues directly to Phase 5

5. **Phase 5 (Meal Prep)**: Create optimized preparation timeline
   - Optional final step: Ask "Vill du exportera veckan till Notion (Inhandling)?" → run `export-to-notion`

### Export to Notion (optional final step)

After Phase 5, the week can be published to the Notion database **💸 Inhandling** via the
`export-to-notion` skill (`/export-to-notion [YYYY-MM-DD]`). This is optional, not a hard
phase gate, and can also be run standalone on any existing week folder.

- **Never duplicate a recipe.** Recipes live in the **Recept** database, not in week pages.
  Before creating anything, match every dish against Recept and link existing ones with
  `<mention-page>`. Recipes that don't exist yet are created **in the Recept database** (so
  they're reusable next week), not as week subpages. A recipe that only exists inside an old
  week page does not count as existing — create a proper recipe page for it.
- **Week-specific adaptations** (scaling, swapped ingredients) are written into the recipe
  page itself, so there is exactly one recipe per dish. Ask first if the change alters the
  dish's character (different main protein, different cooking method).
- **Structure**: one overview page named `Vecka YYYY-MM-DD` (summary + `## Recept` shortcuts
  + `## Innehåll`), with exactly **two subpages**: the shopping list (`03`) and the meal-prep
  plan (`05`).
- **Must run in the main conversation** — Notion MCP isn't guaranteed inside subagents.
- **Inhandling data source** (parent for week pages):
  `collection://26099407-3d52-4deb-9c73-dd54c05d546d` (database "💸 Inhandling",
  `0e540327f8bd4ff68e69d3413d94aa8a`, under the "Matlagning" page).
- **Recept data source** (parent for new recipes):
  `collection://af369de7-03ce-409d-8391-b4183d42e20a` (database "🍲 Recept",
  `a6b869d70c3543e48126902db8525238`, under the "Matlagning" page).
- See `.claude/skills/export-to-notion/SKILL.md` for the full procedure.

### Language & Units

- **Language**: Swedish only
- **Units**: Metric (g, kg, ml, dl, l, msk, tsk, st)
- **Normalization**: Convert to clearer units when appropriate (1000g → 1kg, 10dl → 1l)

### Recipe Sources Priority

**User is a professional chef - prioritize QUALITY over convenience**

1. **Best quality sources** (Swedish or international):
   - Köket.se (high-quality Swedish recipes, chef-tested)
   - Arla (especially for dairy-based dishes)
   - Mitt Kök (authentic Nordic cuisine)
   - Tasteline (professional Swedish chefs)
   - Landleys Kök (high-quality home cooking)
   - International sources when authenticity matters (e.g., Asian cuisine from authentic sources)

2. **Secondary sources**:
   - ICA, Coop (good for basic recipes but not priority)
   - Food blogs (if quality is demonstrably high)

3. **Search strategy**:
   - Compare multiple sources for each recipe
   - Prioritize recipes with professional chef backgrounds
   - Look for techniques and flavor profiles that elevate the dish
   - Balance quality with weekday feasibility (not too advanced)

4. **Always provide clickable links**

### Default Parameters

- **Portions**: 6 per recipe (unless specified otherwise)
- **Meals**: Lunch + dinner
- **Protein focus**: High protein but varied (not low-carb, not vegan)
- **Vegetarian split**: **~80% vegetarian (or easily made vegetarian), ~20% meat/fish** — hard default
  - Vegetarian protein sources to rotate: lentils, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, eggs, halloumi, beans, cheese, quorn
- **Scaling**: Calculate ingredient scaling factors when portions differ from recipe

### Shopping List Generation (Phase 3)

- **Pool ingredients** across all selected recipes
- **Normalize units** for clarity
- **Use butiksvänliga names** (Swedish grocery store names)
- **Categorize**: Grönsaker, Frukt, Mejeri & Ägg, Kött & Fisk, Skafferi, Kryddor & Såser, Fryst, Bröd, Övrigt (+ Hushåll & hygien for stapelvaror)
- **Bullet lists, not tables**: `- <mängd> <ingrediens> (<recept>)` — `validate_week.py` only reads bullets
- **Pantry assumptions**: List separately (salt, pepper, oils) - don't assume silently
- **Mark uncertainties**: Use "(verifiera)" instead of guessing
- **List-sök block**: `## List-sök (Willys)` directly under the header — a `text` code block with
  one product per line, lowercase, no amounts, in store-category order. The user pastes it into
  Willys' list search when ordering. Contains every recipe ingredient plus `varje vecka`
  stapelvaror; excludes salt, pepper, water and unconfirmed `vid behov` items.
- **Stapelvaror**: recurring non-recipe items from `stapelvaror.md` (see below) go in their own
  `## Stapelvaror (återkommande)` section, never mixed into the recipe categories

### Custom Recipes

When creating custom recipes, save as `YYYY-MM-DD/recept-<slug>-<portioner>p.md` and reference from `02-receptval.md` as "Eget recept: `recept-<slug>.md`". Use `/create-recipe` or the `recipe-creator` agent. The format is defined by `.claude/rules/recipe-style.md` and enforced by the recipe hook — see **Recipe Standard: Rules + Hooks** above.

### Meal Prep Planning (Phase 5)

Optimize for minimal total time by:
- Grouping similar tasks (chop all vegetables at once, cook all rice together)
- Parallelizing independent tasks (oven + stovetop + cold prep)
- Reusing bases/sauces when appropriate without sacrificing variety

## Specialized Agents

| Agent | Phase | Model | Purpose | Parallel? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `brainstorming-agent` | 1 | sonnet | Generate 10-20 meal candidates | No |
| `recipe-researcher` | 2 | sonnet | Find best recipe for ONE dish | **Yes — one per dish** |
| `recipe-creator` | 2 | inherit | Write custom recipe from scratch | Per recipe |
| `shopping-list-generator` | 3 | sonnet | Pool ingredients into shopping list | No |
| `recipe-compiler` | 4 | sonnet | Compile all recipes into standardized format | No |
| `meal-prep-optimizer` | 5 | inherit | Create time-optimized prep plan | No |
| `meal-planning-orchestrator` | All | inherit | Coordinate entire workflow | Top-level only |
| `codebase-workflow-analyzer` | — | sonnet | Analyze and improve the multi-agent workflow | No |

## Skills

| Skill | Invocation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `meal-planning-hello-fresh` | Auto or `/meal-planning-hello-fresh` | Main workflow with orchestration |
| `create-recipe` | `/create-recipe [dish] [portions]` | Create a custom recipe |
| `export-to-notion` | `/export-to-notion [YYYY-MM-DD]` | Publish a finished week to Notion (Inhandling) as overview + subpages |

## Recipe Bank

`recept-bank.md` in the project root is a curated list of favorite recipes. The brainstorming agent reads this file at the start of Phase 1 and prioritizes those dishes as candidates, marking them with `★` in the output.

**Format**: Two sections (`Vegetariska favoriter` and `Kött & fisk`), each with columns: `Rätt | Källa/länk | Taggar | Portioner | Notering`

**Behavior**:
- Recipes in the bank are always considered first
- The agent fills remaining slots with fresh suggestions
- `★` markers help the user identify which candidates came from the bank

## Stapelvaror (recurring items)

`stapelvaror.md` in the project root lists household items bought regularly that don't belong
to any recipe (toilet paper, bread, oat milk, coffee, bananas…). `shopping-list-generator` reads
it in Phase 3.

**Format**: one table with columns `Vara | Kategori | Frekvens | Mängd | Notering`, where
`Frekvens` is `varje vecka` or `vid behov`.

**Behavior**:
- `varje vecka` items are always added — under `## Stapelvaror (återkommande)` and in the list-sök block
- `vid behov` items are listed as `Kolla hemma` checkboxes, and only enter list-sök if the user
  confirms them at the Phase 2 stop
- An item that also appears in a recipe is pooled into the recipe line (`+ stapelvara`), not duplicated
- `validate_week.py` ignores the Stapelvaror section when cross-checking recipes, and gives TIPS
  (never FEL) when the list-sök block is missing or lacks an item

## Working with Date Folders

When starting a new week:
1. Create folder: `YYYY-MM-DD/` (use the Monday of that week)
2. Start with Phase 1 brainstorming
3. Follow the phase-gated workflow strictly
4. Reference previous weeks' folders for inspiration but start fresh each time
